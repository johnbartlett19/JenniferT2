            <p> Collage on masonite.  The masonite backing was made with incredible skill by
            John Bartlett, a local nut-job in Brunswick, ME.  The panel is covered with lots of
            pieces of pretty paper and some sticky stuff to make the images.</p>
            <p>Size:  8 x 10 x 23 inches</p>
            <p>You can take this gem home for only $850</p>
